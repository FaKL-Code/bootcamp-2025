Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example 1:

**Input**: `s = "abcabcbb"`  
**Output**: `3`  
**Explanation**: The answer is `"abc"`, with the length of 3.

### Example 2:

**Input**: `s = "bbbbb"`  
**Output**: `1`  
**Explanation**: The answer is `"b"`, with the length of 1.

### Example 3:

**Input**: `s = "pwwkew"`  
**Output**: `3`  
**Explanation**: The answer is `"wke"`, with the length of 3.  
Notice that the answer must be a substring, `"pwke"` is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
